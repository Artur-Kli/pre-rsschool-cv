## 📌 About me:

My first steps in front-end development were at the end of 2018. For several years it was like a hobby in my spare time. By the end of 2022, I had acquired basic knowledge of the entire development stack and decided to make this hobby my main job.
I believe that in 2023, my ability to study will help me fill in the missing knowledge and skills in front-end development for employment. And teamwork will accelerate my growth as a full-stack developer.
